Currently Customer Success Lead at Y42:
- I help analytics teams build scalable data pipelines with SQL & dbt on top of BigQuery or Snowflake. 
- Using data integration tools like Fivetran, Cdata and Airbyte. 
- Working with customers and seeing data setups raise brings me goosebumps.

My ambition:
- Lead driven, customer focused teams
- Help solve problems with data
- Contribute to large scale products
The future of data & AI is bright & I want to play my part in it.

My story: 
- Polish. Studied abroad at TU Berlin when the start-up scene pulled me in at the time of its flourish. 
- Started in venture capital analysing 100+ pitch decks and learning what makes a good team.
- Noticed a critical need for well-designed & easily accessible dashboards so built them at EF (at that time did not know much about data analytics, just learnt about BigQuery and Tableau)
- As a teenager and later at my university always led many initiatives, so my direction was inevitable -> hopped onto the entrepreneurial journey.
- Got selected into CERN out of hundreds of applicants & as the only one with business background.
- Met 3 great academics and started AquaVision â†’ the first, real-time microplastics detector.
- Pitched, landed first traction and partnerships & was invited into the cohort of 10 female founders at Stealth Mode Factory Berlin.
- After not making it to bring AquaVision to the level of outstanding value to the industry, I built up on my data analytics interests. 
- Learnt SQL, Python basics, Git. Built my first data app.
- Landed my job at Y42, 1 month after the bootcamp.

If you catch me outside of work, I record music, enjoy a good audiobook or I'm out for a standup comedy.
